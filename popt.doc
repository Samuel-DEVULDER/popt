			   popt: Peephole OPTimizer
			   ------------------------
				   V1.00 beta

			 (c) by Samuel DEVULDER, 1995.

DESCRIPTION (short):
-------------------

	Popt is an optimizer  of  assembly  sourcefiles.  It  does  various
    standard peephole optimizations by pattern-matching. It ranges  from  1
    instruction lookahead to 3 and many more ! It does more jobs  than	the
    usual built-in assembler optimizer and uses data-flow analysis to  find
    which registers are used or not. With that information it is capable of
    deleting instructions that are of no use and re-assigning registers  to
    produce code of better quality/looking. It	is  specially  powerful  on
    code produced by C-compilers (even those that optimize their code !).

	It is designed to keep the extra-code statements very much the same
    as the original. Thus comments and pseudo-ops are kept intact  so  that
    if they bear special information for the assembler (for debugging,  for
    example), those are kept intact. In fact it makes no assumptions  about
    pseudo-ops and only  works	on  real  micro-processor  operation-codes.
    Therefore, it is useful with any assembler sourcefile in spite of their
    pseudo-op syntax and usage.

USAGE:
-----

    Usage: popt [-revinfo] [flags] <inputfile.asm> [-o <outputfile.asm>]

    Valid optimizer flags are:
	-d	      : Debug
	-v	      : Verbose
	-s	      : Safe optimization only
	-z	      : Optimize size
	-cr <REGMASK> : Set regs refs in jsr (def='')
	-cs <REGMASK> : Set regs sets in jsr (def=D0/D1/A0/A1)
	-ru <REGMASK> : Set regs used after rts (def=D0/D2-D7/A2-A6)
	-4	      : Optimize for 68040
	-2	      : Optimize for 68020/030
	-ns	      : Output new syntax
	-nw	      : Do not display warnings
	-np	      : Suppress stack fixup
	-ni	      : Allow usage of new instructions for 68020+
	-kc	      : Keep lines only containing comments
	-kl	      : Keep unused label
	-sl	      : Put labels in separate lines
	-h	      : This usage (same as -? or ?)

	Use the -revinfo argument if you  wish	to  have  some	information
    about the program: Number of successful compilations done so far,  name
    & size & date of the modules it is build of.

	Be sure that the "-o" flag is followed by the name  of  the  output
    file. This name can be concatenated with the "-o".  So  "-ofoo.asm"  is
    the same as "-o foo.asm". If this flags is not used, the output file is
    the same as the input file.

	Flags can be anywhere on the  command  line.  They  can  be  merged
    together. So "-dvz" is like "-d -v -z". This can work  for  flags  that
    expect an extra argument (such as "-o <filename>"), but the rest of the
    flag will be treated as the  extra	argument.  So  be  careful  because
    "-dvoz foo.asm" will output a file called "z" ! The good way to do this
    is to use "-dvzo foo.asm" or "-dvzofoo.asm" (ie. the 'o' letter must be
    the last of the argument).

    Detailed description of the flags:

	-d:  Outputs some debug information while optimizing,  as  well  as
	     information in the outputfile related  to	live/dead  analysis
	     (in a comment preceded by ';' on each line containing  a  real
	     op-code). Use this for curiosity...  The  comment	is  of	the
	     form: ref=XXXX set=XXXX live=XXXX where  XXXX  stands  for  an
	     hexadecimal  number.  Those  numbers  represent   a   set	 of
	     registers. Bit 1 (lsb) represents A0, Bit 7 represents A7, Bit
	     8: D0, Bit 15 (msb) is D7. The number in  ref=XXXX  represents
	     the registers referenced (bit set means a referenced register)
	     by the  instruction  on  that  line.  The	one  with  set=XXXX
	     represents registers that are set and the live=XXXX represents
	     registers that are alive for that instruction. This  can  help
	     to know why POPT did or did not do an optimization.

	-v:  Outputs some statistics about the optimizations  and  the file
	     being optimized.

	-s:  Avoid making optimizations that can make  your  program behave
	     wrongly. (It's hard to really guarantee this statement :-).

	-z:  Avoid optimizations that increase the size of the output (that
	     is to say, roughly, optimizations of mul operations).

	-4:  Perform  specific	optimizations  for  the  68040.  Note  that
	     code optimized for a 68000 may work slower (proportionally) on
	     a 68040.

	-2:  Perform  specific	optimizations  for  the 68020/68030  micro-
	     processors. Same remark as for '-4' flag.

	-ru: Set registers that are used after	a  RTS	instruction.  Those
	     registers are those in which return values of functions are in
	     registers not scratched by the function  call  (ie.  registers
	     pushed  onto  the	stack  in  a  function).  By  default  only
	     D0/D2-D7/A2-A6 are assumed for that purpose. If you don't know
	     what registers your compiler use, or if you  wish	to  make  a
	     safer optimization, use D0-D7/A0-A7 as <REGMASK>. <REGMASK> is
	     a register mask. A  register  mask  is  a	list  of  registers
	     separated by '/'. You can use a '-' between two  registers  to
	     describe  all  registers  betweens  those	two  (a  range   of
	     registers). For example D0-D2 is the same as D0/D1/D2.

	-cs: Set registers that are set (scratched) in jsr/bsr calls. Those
	     registers are supposed to be set by the code executed  by	the
	     jsr. Those registers include also the register(s) that bear(s)
	     the return value of the function. By default, D0-D1/A0-A1	are
	     used as such scratch registers. If you wish to  make  a  safer
	     optimization, you should use an empty mask of  registers  (use
	     '' for that).

	-cr: Set registers that are used in jsr/bsr calls. Those  registers
	     are supposed to be used for passing variables  to	a  function
	     without using the stack. By default, no registers are  assumed
	     for that (empty <REGMASK>).  If  you  wish  to  make  a  safer
	     optimization, you can use D0-D7/A0-A6 as <REGMASK>.

	-ns: This  forces  POPT  to  output a  code  with the new  MOTOROLA
	     syntax.  With this,  -4(A5) will be printed as (-4,A5). Please
	     note that	the new  syntax  may  be  bad  interpreted by  your
	     assembler as a sub-mode of a new addressing mode and hence may
	     slow down your program !

	-nw: With that option, POPT will  not  complain  about	an  unknown
	     addressing mode or opcode. Use this if you  are  using  68020+
	     opcodes (like bitfields) and you know that POPT will  complain
	     about it (see BUG section for further explanations).

	-np: This option tells POPT to avoid stack optimizations.

	-ni: With   this  option,  POPT   will	 occasionally	use   68020
	     instructions or addressing mode.

	-kc: This prevents POPT from deleting empty lines that consist only
	     of comments. NOTE: This can disable some optimizations.

	-kl: This makes POPT keep all labels. Even if some are unused.	Use
	     this if you code is to be included in an other  one  and  POPT
	     removes some labels (it can't figure out  which  one  must  be
	     kept, because  there  is  no  xdef  or  so  for  that  way  of
	     programming).

	-sl: POPT will put all your labels on separate lines. Use this	for
	     aesthetic reasons. Some people told me  that  they  think	the
	     optimized code is much more readable like that (Hello FLINT  !
	     :-).

MORE DESCRIPTION:
----------------

	We can describe peephole optimizations by saying that  the  program
    looks for special pattern locally in the code  (with  a  window  of  1,
    2,... contiguous instructions) and replace it by another one  that	is
    executed faster by the microprocessor.

	These optimizations are safe for the data. That is to say that	the
    results (in the data/registers) of the sequence of instructions do  not
    change when replaced. However, these are not safe for the control flags
    of the processor (i.e. some flags may be wrong when  some  instructions
    are replaced), so the code may execute wrongly.  It  is  very  hard  to
    combine optimizations with strict flags preservation, but popt does its
    best to do so.

	By default it doesn't care about flags  preservation  (that  allows
    more optimizations), but you  can  make  it  more  secure  by  avoiding
    optimizations that might give wrong flags. Anyway, BE WARNED THAT, even
    so, OPTIMIZATIONS ARE NOT 100% SECURE, and you should test	INTENSIVELY
    an optimized program to see if its behaviour is correct. I can tell you
    that most C-program are ok, since they  don't  rely  on  strange  flags
    (Carry, Halfbyte, Overflow, ...) and  on  flags  set  by  instructions.
    Indeed, the compiler usually uses a test instruction to reset the flags
    in the right state instead of relying on values previously set by  side
    effect.

	Although it does speed	optimizations,	you  can  prevent  it  from
    optimizations that increase size.

	The data-flow analysis is used to determine for each instruction in
    the code which register is dead or not. A register is said to  be  dead
    in an instruction if its value is not used by some intructions that can
    be executed after the one considered. For example, register D0 is  dead
    for instructions just before MOVE.L #0,D0 because the value  of  D0  is
    about to be scratched by the move operation. A  register  that  is	not
    dead is said to be (... guess !) alive. An operation that references D0
    brings it back to life.

	POPT uses well kwown peephole  optimizations  that  keep  the  data
    intact such as quick move, additions, subtraction, replace .L operation
    by .W for A-registers, replace a MUL instruction by a  shift  one  (and
    many more:	see  the  other  documentation	file  containing  the  list
    (peephole.doc)) ... but it can do more by using the data-flow analysis.
    For example, it can transform a CMPI  instruction  by  a  SUBQ  if	the
    register is dead or suppress an instruction that sets a dead  register.
    It can even find temporary-scrach registers to perform  replacement  of
    MUL by SHIFT & ADD.

	In addition to	peephole  optimizations,  it  can  do  some  global
    optimizations such as branch optimizations (branch to branch, branch to
    next instruction,  branch  to  conditional	branch,  branch  inversion,
    pre-computing  a  conditional  branch),   suppression   of	LINK/UNLINK
    instruction if the link'ed register is not  used  (good  for  low-level
    routine in C !), deleting unused regs in MOVEM instruction and  merging
    multiple labels (just for sourcefile  size  optimization,  good-looking
    source and, actually, for secret internal purpouse :^) ).

	It can also replace a register by another one to avoid silly  moves
    that usually occur in code generated by C  compilers.  For	example  it
    replaces the sequence

		MOVE.L	D3,D1
		LSL.L	D5,D1
		ADD.L	D2,D1
		MOVE.L	D1,D4
    by
		MOVE.L	D3,D4
		LSL.L	D5,D4
		ADD.L	D2,D4

    The code looks better, doesn't it ? And it takes one instruction  less!
    Those replacements are done independently of local windows. So they are
    a kind of global optimization.  It	can  also  detect  when  A-register
    pre-decrement  or  post-increment  modes  can  be  used  so  that  a  C
    expression like a=*ptr++ can be  efficiently  translated  to  something
    like MOVE.L (A0)+,D0 even if the compiler uses a strange sequence like:

		MOVE.L	A0,A6
		ADD.L	#4,A0
		MOVE.L	(A6),D0

	POPT is able to simulate part of a code  to  avoid  an	unnecessary
     test. Thus it can detect code  generated  by  for(;;)  statement  like
     {short i,j;for(i=10;i--;++j);} (generated by DCC):

		MOVEQ	#10,D2
		BRA	l4
	    l1
	    l2
		ADDQ.W	#$01,D3
	    l4
		MOVE.W	D2,D0
		SUBQ.W	#$01,D2
		TST.W	D0
		BNE	l1

    and replace it by a very efficient code:

		MOVEQ	#9,D2
	    l1	ADDQ.W	#1,D3
	    l4	DBF	D2,l1

    Nice, isn't it ? (The test in the first iteration in the loop is always
    true, so POPT removes the branch to l4 and replace 10 by 9 !).

	The 68040 and 68020 optimizations  include  re-arrangement  of	the
    code to prevent pipeline stalls, expansion of movem to multiples moves,
    and inversion of most 68000 optimizations that are really bad for  that
    microprocessor (see peephole.doc to see the list).

	I'm not responsible for the dammage that this program can  do.  Use
    it at your own risk. It is given "as is". Have in mind that, this  kind
    of program is not guaranteed to be safe. This  archive  is	copyrighted
    but freeware. You can redistribute it for free (or little  media  cost)
    provided the archive is kept unadulterated.

	It was based initially on the optimizer of  the  HCC  distribution,
    top ((c) Sozobon ltd.), but it has been modified and improved a lot  to
    suit my needs. Anyway, it helped me a lot with the data-flow  analysis.
    Some optimizations came from  the  ASP68K  project	(by  Michael  Glew,
    January  1994,  mglew@laurel.ocs.mq.edu.au),   Pascal   Lauly   (lauly@
    cnam.fr) who helped me a lot with 68040-optimizations),  Loïc  Maréchal
    (marechal@cnam.fr) who helped me  with  68020-optimizations,  and  from
    other sources I don't remember. I thank them very much, since  I'm  not
    an ASM-wizard, they helped me a lot.

	Special thanks to James Conwell for "optimizing" this  docfile  and
    correcting my sometimes buggy English. :)  *sigh*  Hey,  I	can  hardly
    write French without error (ask people on IRC).. so my English can't be
    good.

	That program is about 250Kb and 11600 lines of C code. It has  been
    compiled with the non-registered dcc version of DICE, by Matt DILLON.

	This program was initially build with this configuration:  a  stock
    A500, KS1.3, 512Kb CHIP + 512Kb FAST, one single diskdrive. In fact,  I
    must have been mad to stay with that configuration it  takes  a  *VERY*
    long time to compile: Use the '-revinfo' option to see  the  number  of
    successful compilations and multiply it by 5 mins (actually, to compile
    a file it takes at least 10 mins with my config. ;-). Then I think	you
    can see how long it takes for me to make a full re-compilation :-). Now
    I've upgraded a little bit, but I must say this program  can  still  be
    built with my previous configuration.

	You can ask me for the sources via e-mail  (not  too  many requests
    please :-). Note that it is bigger than  250Ko, so think about the size
    of your mailbox first !

BUGS:
----

	POPT is unable to expand macros. Thus LIBCALL macro is	treated  as
    an unknown instruction. This modifies register live/death analysis	and
    can avoid some optimizations (unknown instructions  use  all  registers
    for safety !). But the code will certainly be more optimized  than	the
    original, anyway.

	POPT doesn't know addressings modes specific for the 68020+. If  it
    finds such an  unknown  addressing	mode,  it  will  output  a  warning
    message, and will do no optimization on that mode. But  it	won't  fail
    because it didn't know an addressing mode or an instruction. The  '-ni'
    option does not allow POPT to recognize those opcodes. It just tells it
    to use new-opcodes for output.

	POPT works better on compiler generated code. Code written by  hand
    is	usually  very  powerfull  and  well  optimized	anyway	(usage   of
    automatically set flags). On that kind of writing/optimization POPT  is
    likely to create a bugged code, even if the '-s' option is  used  (POPT
    did not detail flags, and some code relies on  instructions  that  only
    touch a part of the status register). Try  to  test  heavily  to  check
    before using a POPT'ed code of that kind (doing  the  optimizations  by
    yourself instead is far more safer).

	You should have in mind that if you use the safe  option  and  safe
    setup (for -cs, -cr, -ru), many optimizations will not be done. I think
    that you can safely not use the -s option if the code is generated by a
    C compiler (those are not clever enough to use very smart optimizations
    (differenciation of half data registers, taking into account  automatic
    flags setting/preservations through instructions, for example)).

	Beware that if your code is using half-registers, POPT is likely to
    produce a buggy code, because it does not care about lower/higher  word
    of a register. So avoid putting things in registers high-word,  because
    they'll probably be scratched by some optimization. In fact  this  only
    applies if your code was written by hand. (I don't think a compiler can
    use half-registers to store data).
